# Automated-attendance-system-using-image-capture
This project automates classroom attendance using image capture and facial recognition technology, eliminating the need for manual roll-calls or physical signatures. The system uses Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) for face recognition, providing a reliable, fast, and efficient solution for educational institutions.

 Features:
Automatic attendance marking using face recognition
Real-time image capture and student identification
Face Detection using Haar Cascade Classifier
Face Recognition using LBPH Algorithm
GUI built using Tkinter for smooth interaction
Attendance stored and tracked digitally
Eliminates proxy attendance and manual errors
